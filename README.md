# Remove Links

An extension that allows you to disable certain hyperlink protocols on a page. The main purpose is to disable the mailto protocol. But I figured I would try to add the feature to just list whatever protocols you don't like (http, tel, whatever).

Current Features:

- Can turn it on and off
- Disables all links in the source page
- Get all the links to turn off, like all the ones added by other scripts

Next:

- Restore links back to the way they were after disabling the extension
- Add a list of protocol to ignore, have it default to mailto

Future:

- White/Black listing?
